# Self Learn AI Ethics and Safety

This repository hosts a list of courses, tutorials, newsletters and other resources related to Ethics in AI for my self-learning journey. I came across Ethical AI during my KaggleX BIPOC Mentorship Program and OpenMined's Privacy AI Mentorship Program. I will be taking up different courses on Ethics and post self-notes.
